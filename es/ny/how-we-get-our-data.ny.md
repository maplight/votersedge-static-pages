title: How we get our data
published: true
---
The data that appears on Voter’s Edge New York comes from a variety of sources, with priority placed on collecting data that is nonpartisan, transparent, and accurate. Voter’s Edge New York is a project of MapLight. Voter’s Edge New York does not take any position on or express any preference about the issues or candidates displayed on this site and neither supports nor opposes candidates or political parties.
 
## What’s on the ballot
 
The official election authorities for the state, counties, and other localities are the ultimate authority on what contests, candidates, and ballot measures will appear on the ballot. This data is either directly provided to us by the election authorities or collected from them by the Voter’s Edge New York team.
 
Voter’s Edge New York is not responsible for the accuracy of the sample ballot and polling location data. Your local election authority remains the sole authoritative source for information regarding the content of ballot and polling place location. If you believe that either the polling place or ballot data is inaccurate, please [Contact Us](www.votersedge.org/en/ny/feedback) to report the problem.
 
## Polling locations
 
Polling locations are sourced directly from the applicable election authorities or supplied by the [Google Civic Information API](https://developers.google.com/civic-information/?hl=en). 
 
## The address search
 
* Voter’s Edge New York uses data provided by state and local election authorities and the [Google Civic Information API](https://developers.google.com/civic-information/?hl=en) to return ballot data for a specific address.
 
* In some situations we will return more contests than will be on your actual ballot. This can happen when there is insufficient data available to correctly connect an office to its specific district. When this happens, we will connect the office to a larger district — typically a city or a county — and return the contests for that office for all addresses in that larger district. This means that some of the contests returned might not be on your actual ballot. Contests that may not be on your ballot will be indicated. You can contact your local election authority to confirm if a contest will actually be on your ballot.
 
* It is possible to search using only a zip code, however this will not produce the most specific results possible. When only a zip code is used, Voter’s Edge New York may be unable to accurately return all contests, which means there could be contests on your actual ballot that will not be returned. Enter a full address for the most specific results possible. 
 
Please see our [Privacy Policy](www.votersedge.org/ny/page/privacy-policy) for more information on how addresses are used.
 
 
## Candidate data
 
The candidate data appearing on Voter’s Edge New York can come from three sources.
 
**1. The election authority:** Source of the initial data, such as the candidate’s name, party, and what office they are running for. In some cases the applicable election authority may also be the source of contact information.
 
**2. Directly from the candidates:** Candidates are invited to participate by submitting important data about their candidacies directly to Voter’s Edge New York. In order to submit content, candidates must agree to the following terms:
 
**_The content shall not, in any way, make reference to other candidates for this office or to another candidate's qualifications, character, or activities. Moreover, the content shall not contain any demonstrably false, slanderous, or libelous statements or any obscene or profane language, statements or insinuations. _**
 
**_I accept responsibility for the truth and accuracy of the content submitted to Voter’s Edge New York by myself, the candidate, or by my designated preparer. _**
 
**_I agree that the content submitted to Voter’s Edge New York may be published for this election and retained in a permanent public archive._**
 
Content submitted by candidates is not checked for accuracy and spelling and grammatical errors are not corrected by Voter’s Edge New York. Content is reviewed to ensure that it does not refer to opponents. Voter’s Edge New York does not take any responsibility for the style, content, accuracy or truthfulness of the information provided by candidates.

**3. Researched by the Voter’s Edge New York team:** Our preference is to always have candidates participate and submit their data directly to Voter’s Edge New York, however if a candidate has not chosen to participate, our researchers may provide additional data. In these situations, the research would be done for all non-participating candidates running for the same office, so as not to advantage one candidate over another. All candidates within a contest are researched using the same standards, with comparable time and energy put into each, and no preference given to party or ideology. When candidates are researched by Voter’s Edge New York, this will be indicated on their profiles. A candidate being researched is still encouraged to start participating in Voter’s Edge New York, at which time they would take responsibility for entering and maintaining their own data.

## Analysis of campaign finance data from MapLight

MapLight obtains its campaign finance data on federal candidates from the bulk files provided by the [Federal Election Commission (FEC)](http://www.fec.gov/). The data is processed, cleaned, and updated daily to include both new filings and amendments to previous filings.
 
### Candidate data
 
The candidate campaign finance data visible on Voter’s Edge New York consists of contributions to the principal, authorized campaign committees of candidates running for a given office. This does not include contributions to super PACs, leadership PACs, or joint fundraising committees.

**Note:** Regarding federal campaign finance data, there can be a lag between when the FEC publishes a recent filing's summary numbers and when the individual contributions are released in their bulk data. As a result, the totals in the bottom three sections ("Who gave contributions?", "Who gave the most money?", "Top contributions by state") may not add up to the totals above ("Contributions to candidate", "How big are the contributions?").
  
### Top contributor lists
MapLight generates top-contributor lists by standardizing and then aggregating several types of information. Contributor names are standardized by a combination of automated processes and extensive manual review by MapLight researchers. We correct misspellings, connect PACs to their relevant organizations, and combine similar name variants together in order to better aggregate contributor information.
Contribution amounts from an organization to a candidate combine the sum of its employees' contributions or from its PAC. This is standard practice in campaign finance, where candidate committee contribution limits typically mean that single organizations or their PACs contribute the maximum (or "max out") very quickly. To the extent that employee contributions may reflect the interests of the employer, their contributions are aggregated with the employer. One significant exception to this practice pertains to contributions without limits, including from candidates who contribute to their own campaigns. Contributions not subject to limits are not aggregated at the level of the employer organization. In the event that a top-ranked contributor (by employer) is a category such as "self-employed" or "retired", we exclude it from the list.
 
### Contributions by state
An analysis of all itemized contributions broken down by the state the contributor supplied.
 
### Contributions by size
An analysis breaking contributions into the categories of ‘small’ and ‘large’ based on whether the recipient committee itemized the contributions. Federally, campaign committees are not required to itemize contributions under $200. Unitemized contributions are considered ‘small’ and itemized contributions are considered ‘large’ for this analysis.
 
### Contributions by type
An analysis breaking contributions into the categories of ‘organization’ and ‘individual.’ This analysis identifies the contributions coming from organizations (either directly or via political action committees) or by individuals.
