### History of Voter’s Edge
MapLight’s Voter’s Edge tool was first designed to help expose the funders behind ballot measures in California. In recent years the project has expanded to cover candidates and elections in states beyond California. Voter’s Edge is currently covering federal, state, and local elections in California, Illinois, and New York.

### About MapLight

MapLight is a nonpartisan research organization that reveals money’s influence on politics. We are a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.

We provide journalists and citizens with transparency tools that connect data on campaign contributions, politicians, legislative votes, industries, companies, and more to show patterns of influence never before possible to see. These tools allow users to gain unique insights into how campaign contributions affect policy, so they can draw their own conclusions about how money influences our political system.
