## Voter's Edge Privacy Policy

Effective Date: February 10, 2016
________________________________________
**Welcome to Voter’s Edge.**

We take your privacy seriously. We are a non-profit project and will never sell your information to third parties. We are committed to protecting your privacy in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. 

This Privacy Policy is a binding agreement between you and VE (a project of [MapLight](http://maplight.org/) and in partnership with the [League of Women Voters California Education Fund](https://cavotes.org/) for VE California) regarding the use of the Votersedge.org websites and associated services (“VE,” the “Platform” or the “Site”). Please read this Privacy Policy before using or submitting content in any form or medium on the Site.

By visiting or submitting content on the Site, you agree to abide and be bound by this Privacy Policy. VE reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time, and you agree to be bound by any such changes. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features or functionalities (including, without limitation, video and related projects) that augment or enhance our site shall be subject to this Privacy Policy.

Please review VE’s [Terms of Use](www.votersedge.org/page/terms-of-use) in conjunction with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy or the VE Terms of Use, please do not use the Site.
Our Privacy Policy outlines how we get and use information about you, who we share it with, and how you can control your privacy settings. 

### What’s in This Policy

#### I.	Information VE Collects
The following provides an overview of the information VE collects in the course of your use of our Site. VE only collects data for your use of this Site. VE will not share or sell your information with a third party.
#### a. What We Collect
Through your general use of our Site, VE may collect and/or receive the following information about you that reveals your specific identity, or is directly tied to your specific identity:
* Your zip code;
* Your physical address;
* Your name, state, email address, and any feedback left in the open response form (if you voluntarily provide this information by using the Feedback form on our site); 
* Your voting selections that you elect on the Site;
* Your social media account ID and information shared with us via your social media account if you use the Facebook, Twitter and email sharing functions on the Site; and
* Your credit card or PayPal information for the purposes of processing payment if you make a donation to the Site, VE or MapLight.

And possibly:
* Information about you that VE gets from third party data providers. VE obtains this data with assurance from these providers that you have consented to the collecting and sharing of this data. VE does not actively collect sensitive public data such as medical data. In addition, we only collect information that is permissible to collect in each state where VE operates.
VE also collects information that does not reveal your specific identity, or does not directly relate to you, such as:
* Browser and device information;
* Information collected through cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies; and
* Demographic information and other non-identifying information provided by you (such as a zip code or general geographic area).

#### b. How VE Collects This Information

* User-provided information: When you visit the VE platform, you are asked to enter in your zip code and street address so that we can provide you with accurate information about the upcoming election and what candidates and initiatives will be on the ballot in your area. VE also uses this information to provide you with information regarding prior years’ elections.
* Cookies and online tracking: VE and its service providers may use cookies, pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs), and other similar technologies to measure and track general user activities on VE and on third party websites. 
* Third-party analytics providers: VE uses Google Analytics to collect anonymized information on user demographics and interests to help measure our impact and effectiveness. Google Analytics uses cookies and anonymous identifiers to produce these anonymized reports. If you wish to opt-out and prevent your non-personally identifiable from being used by Google Analytics, you may do so here. The Voter’s Edge address look-up tool is powered by Google’s Open Civic API and is therefore subject to Google’s Privacy Policy.
* IP Address: Your “IP Address” is a designator that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet service provider (ISP). An IP Address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you use our platform and services, along with the time of your visit and the specific page(s) that you visited.

#### II.	How VE May Use Your Information

#### III.	Who May Receive Your Information

This is how VE shares the information we collect through your use of the VE Site. 

**a.**	This information will not be sold to third parties. We are a non-profit project.
**b.**	Any research and analysis done or shared with the intent to better the platform offerings will only be used and shared in an anonymized format.
**c.**	California law permits residents of California to request certain details about what personal information a company shares with third parties for the third parties' marketing purposes. If you have questions about our sharing practices or your rights under California law, please contact our Privacy Officer with the contact details listed at the end of this Privacy Policy.

**d.**	Administrative Purposes

VE may share your information with third parties for the following purposes:

**i.**	VE suppliers, subcontractors and partners (“service providers”): VE may share information about you with our services providers who process information to provide services to us or on our behalf. We have contracts with our service providers that prohibit them from sharing the information about you that they collect or receive with anyone else or from using such information for other purposes.

**ii.**	Fraud prevention: VE may disclose the personal information VE collects about its users when we believe disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or respond to suspected illegal or fraudulent activity or to protect the safety, rights, or property of us, its users, or others.

**iii.**	Law enforcement purposes: If requested or required by government authorities, such as law enforcement authorities, courts, or regulators, or otherwise to comply with the law, VE may have to disclose any information VE has about our users. VE also may disclose information collected about you in order to exercise or protect legal rights or defend against legal claims.
#### IV.	Children’s Privacy

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important to VE. For that reason, VE does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information or non-personally identifiable information from users under 13 years of age. 

If VE learns that personally identifiable information of users under the age of 13 has been collected, VE will delete the child’s information.

#### V.	Your Privacy Choices

**a.**	Opting Out of Third Party Analytics Companies 

To opt out of Google Analytics, please go to https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. 
These opt-outs may be provided through the use of specific tracking opt-out cookies. Please note that if you get a new computer, install a new browser, or erase or otherwise alter your browser’s cookie file (including upgrading certain browsers), this may also clear the opt-out cookie.

**b.**	Accessing or Deleting Your Information

If you want, you can ask VE for the information we have about you and even ask us to delete it.

If you would like to review, correct, update, suppress, or delete information that has been previously provided to us by you, you can contact our Privacy Officer at the email address or mailing address listed at the bottom of this Privacy Policy and ask us to specify what information we have about you and to delete certain information about you from our records. Please let us know what information you would like us to remove from our databases or otherwise let us know what limitations you would like to put on our use of your personal information. For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the personal information associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.

Please note that we may need to retain certain information for mandatory record keeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to your request. There may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records, but such residual information will no longer be tied to your identity. 

#### VI.	Data Retention & Security

VE seeks to use reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect your information within our organization from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, and/or destruction. We take reasonable steps to ensure that all data we process is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete and current to the extent necessary for the purposes for which we use it. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting our Privacy Officer using the contact details listed at the end of this Privacy Policy.
We will retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required by law.
#### VII.	Your California Privacy Rights

Since 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.  We do not share user’s personal information with unaffiliated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.
