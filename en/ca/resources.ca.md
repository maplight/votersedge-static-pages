## Create Your Own Guide: Set up a version of Voter’s Edge California for your organization  

An easy way for organizations to partner with Voter’s Edge California is to request a subdomain. A subdomain is a complete and co-branded version of the voter guide that can be customized with a unique URL, title, color scheme, and your organization’s logo. If you would like to request a subdomain for your website, please ‘[Contact Us](http://votersedge.org/en/ca/feedback)’ for more information.  

Note: Subdomains cannot be used by candidates, political parties, or PACs, nor by any organization to attempt to influence the outcome of an election or to engage in other prohibited political activities as described in [IRS code 26 USC 501(c)(3)](http://1.usa.gov/1lvMCT3).

The logo is available in various sizes, background colors, and file types. To download a zip file containing the Voter’s Edge California logo, [click here](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ve-resources/Voter%27s+Edge+California.zip).  

Each zip file contains:

These logos can be used as buttons that link your users to [our homepage](http://votersedge.org/en/ca).  

**Share a custom link.**  

You can bypass the Voter’s Edge California homepage entirely by entering a street address directly into a URL that will take you right to the results. Use the structure described below to generate a URL that will take you to the results for any street address or zip code.  

This is a great feature for organizations that do bulk mailings to larger groups of people for whom they have addresses. The tool allows you to send your subscribers a customized link based on their street address.  

**Address Lookup**  
Voter’s Edge California has created an [Excel spreadsheet](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ve-resources/URL-Address+Tool.xlsx) to make this process easier and to allow you to quickly generate large numbers of unique, address-specific URLs. To use this spreadsheet, follow these instructions:  

 1. Select the “CA” tab at the bottom of the Excel spreadsheet. 
 
 2. Enter an address in the first four columns:  
 
  a. **Example address:** 2119 Stanbridge Avenue, Long Beach, CA 90815  
  b. **Street_Number:** This is number of the house or building (2119 from the example above)  
  c. **Street_1:** This is the name of the street (Stanbridge from the example above)  
  d. **Street_2:** This is the type of street (Avenue from the example above) _**Note:**_ You may enter this either as “Ave”, “Ave.” or “Avenue” and it will work.  
  e. **Zip:** This is the zip code (90815 from the example above)  
  
 3. Click the link that appears in the column labeled URL, or copy and paste it.

**Zip Code Lookup**  
The URL structure for a zip code-only search is the same as for an address search, but the address information is left blank.  

You can also use the [Excel spreadsheet](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ve-resources/URL-Address+Tool.xlsx) to generate a URL for a zip code-only ballot search. Simply follow the same instructions as above, but leave the first three fields blank (i.e., only fill in the **Zip** field).
